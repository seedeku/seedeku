- 👋 Hi, I’m @seedeku

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Game Development (Unreal Engine), and building cool projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms to crack top companies like FAANG. I’m also exploring frontend development and aim to become a full-stack developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web projects, open-source contributions, and game development projects.
